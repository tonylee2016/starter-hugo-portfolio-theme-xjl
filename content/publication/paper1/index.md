abstract: A Battery Cloud or cloud battery management system leverages the cloud
  computational power and data storage to improve battery safety, performance,
  and economy. This work will present the Battery Cloud that collects measured
  battery data from electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Advanced
  algorithms are applied to improve battery performance. Using remote vehicle
  data, we train and validate an artificial neural network to estimate pack SOC
  during vehicle charging. The strategy is then tested on vehicles. Furthermore,
  high accuracy and onboard battery state of health estimation methods for
  electric vehicles are developed based on the differential voltage (DVA) and
  incremental capacity analysis (ICA). Using cycling data from battery cells at
  various temperatures, we extract the charging cycles and calculate the DVA and
  ICA curves, from which multiple features are extracted, analyzed, and
  eventually used to estimate the state of health. For battery safety, a
  data-driven thermal anomaly detection method is developed. The method can
  detect unforeseen anomalies such as thermal runaways at the very early stage.
  With the further development of the internet of things, more and more battery
  data will be available. Potential applications of battery cloud also include
  areas such as battery manufacture, recycling, and electric vehicle battery
  swap.
