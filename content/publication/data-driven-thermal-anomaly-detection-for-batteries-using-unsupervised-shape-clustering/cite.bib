Thermal anomaly detection can identify problematic battery packs that may eventually undergo thermal runaway. However, there are common challenges like data unavailability, environment and configuration variations, and battery aging. We propose a data-driven method to detect battery thermal anomaly based on comparing shape-similarity between thermal measurements. Based on their shapes, the measurements are continuously being grouped into different clusters. Anomaly is detected by monitoring deviations within the clusters. Unlike model-based or other data-driven methods, the proposed method is robust to data loss and requires minimal reference data for different pack configurations. As the initial experimental results show, the method not only can be more accurate than the onboard BMS and but also can detect unforeseen anomalies at the early stage.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576348},  ISSN={2163-5145},  month={June},}
