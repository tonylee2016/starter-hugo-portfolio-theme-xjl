Two main characteristics make the charge-end time span a good opportunity to correct SOC estimation: first, it is easy to detect when the battery is at the last stage of charging because the charging profile is known to the BMS designer and also during the charge-end time span the amount of current is low, and the terminal voltage of the battery cells are high; second, as the battery reaches the charge-end stage, we know that the true SOC is approaching to 100%. This paper presents a method to utilize these important features to correct the SOC estimation error. Using a voltage threshold method, the algorithm detects when the battery is close to the charge-end to activate the charge-end SOC correction strategy. Once activated, the strategy corrects the SOC using the maximum cell voltage to guarantee that SOC is 100% when charging is complete. The amount of correction is a function of maximum cell voltage and the charge current C-rate.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/VPPC53923.2021.9699170},  ISSN={1938-8756},  month={Oct},}
