title: Onboard Battery SOC Estimation
summary: Using battery cell charging data stored in [Gotionâ€™s](https://www.gotion.com/) cloud data platform, we train and validate a neural network to estimate pack state of charge (SOC) during vehicle charging. The impact on CPU and memory resources of the microcontroller is evaluated first. Then, we evaluate the neural network-based SOC estimator on test vehicles with promising the results (< 3%).
