title: Data-driven Battery SOH Estimation
summary: We developed a high accuracy battery state of health estimation method based on the differential voltage (DVA) and incremental capacity analysis (ICA) for electric vehicles. Using cycling data from lithium-ion battery cells at various temperatures, we extracted multiple features, which are brought into correlation with the capacity fade. A linear regression model is calculated between the selected features at various temperatures.
