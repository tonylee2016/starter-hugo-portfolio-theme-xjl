abstract = {A Battery Cloud or cloud battery management system leverages the cloud computational power and data storage to improve battery safety, performance, and economy. This work will present the Battery Cloud that collects measured battery data from electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Advanced algorithms are applied to improve battery performance. Using remote vehicle data, we train and validate an artificial neural network to estimate pack SOC during vehicle charging. The strategy is then tested on vehicles. Furthermore, high accuracy and onboard battery state of health estimation methods for electric vehicles are developed based on the differential voltage (DVA) and incremental capacity analysis (ICA). Using cycling data from battery cells at various temperatures, we extract the charging cycles and calculate the DVA and ICA curves, from which multiple features are extracted, analyzed, and eventually used to estimate the state of health. For battery safety, a data-driven thermal anomaly detection method is developed. The method can detect unforeseen anomalies such as thermal runaways at the very early stage. With the further development of the internet of things, more and more battery data will be available. Potential applications of battery cloud also include areas such as battery manufacture, recycling, and electric vehicle battery swap.},

abstract = {The modeling and control of a recently developed utility-scale, shaftless, hubless, high strength steel energy storage flywheel system (SHFES) are presented. The novel flywheel is designed with an energy/power capability of 100 kWh/100 kW and has the potential of a doubled energy density when compared to conventional technologies. In addition, it includes a unique combination magnetic bearing (CAMB) capable of providing five-degrees-of-freedom (5DOF) magnetic levitation. Initial test results show that the CAMB, which weighs 544 kg, can provide a stable lift-up and levitation control for the 5543 kg flywheel. The object of this paper is to formulate and synthesize a detailed model as well as to design and simulate a closed-loop control system for the proposed flywheel system. To this end, the CAMB supporting structures are considered flexible and modeled by finite element modeling. The magnetic bearing is characterized experimentally by static and frequency-dependent coefficients, the latter of which are caused by eddy current effects and presents a challenge to the levitation control. Sensor-runout disturbances are also measured and included. System nonlinearities in power amplifiers and the controller are considered as well. Even though the flywheel has a large ratio of the primary-to-transversal moment of inertias, multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) feedback control demonstrates its effectiveness in canceling gyroscopic toques at the designed operational spinning speed. Various stages of proportional and derivative (PD) controllers, lead/lag compensators, and notch filters are implemented to suppress the high-frequency sensor disturbances, structural vibrations, and rotor imbalance effects.},

abstract = {This chapter considers energy stored in the form of mechanical kinetic and potential energy. This includes well-established pumped hydroelectric storage (pumped hydro) and flywheels as well as more recent concepts of gravity and buoyancy energy storage. While other sources may consider compressed air energy storage (CAES) as mechanical energy storage by the compression and expansion of gas, there is significant thermal aspect to that technology that warrants its inclusion in the chapter on heat engine-based systems elsewhere in this book. Pumped hydro is a proven commercial technology where water is pumped (energy input) from a low reservoir to a high reservoir for storage, then the water in the high reservoir is allowed to return to the low reservoir through a turbine to extract energy. Flywheels, also proven commercially in several applications, store kinetic energy of a rotating mass: energy is added by driving the flywheel shaft with a motor, and energy is extracted by allowing the shaft to drive a generator. Gravity and buoyancy energy storage concepts are fundamentally similar in that they deal with relative positioning of a static load in a potential energy field. This chapter discusses the technical details and current applications of these technologies, including aspects of design and performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents the conceptual design of a lightweight and high-speed kinetic battery to capture the braking energy and provide thrust for electric or hybrid vehicles. By acting as a high-power buffer, the proposed kinetic battery is intended to improve drive range, main battery life cycles, and to downsize vehicle powertrains. It is designed to store and release braking energy of a mid-sized vehicle (573Wh), with a flywheel only weighs about 11.2 Kg. The flywheel, which has a maximum spin speed of 50,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), is composed of shells/rims of high strength steel and composite materials that are designed and validated by finite element analysis (FEA). The novel hybrid, multi-rim and multi-material rotor design yields a higher energy density and less weight than the conventional single or multi-rim design. In addition, a five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) magnetic bearing system is incorporated to provide frictionless support.},

abstract = {IEEE This paper proposes a framework for the design and analysis of a coreless permanent magnet (PM) machine for a 100 kWh shaft-less high strength steel flywheel energy storage system (SHFES). The PM motor/generator is designed to meet the required specs in terms of torque-speed and power-speed characteristics given by the application. The design challenges of a motor/generator for this architecture include: the poor flux paths due to a large scale solid carbon steel rotor and zero-thermal convection of the airgap due to operation of the machine in vacuum. Magnetic flux in this architecture tends to be 3-D rather than constrained due to lack of core in the stator. In order to tackle these challenges, several other parameters such as a proper number of magnets and slots combination, wire thickness, number of turns in each coil, magnets with high saturated flux density and magnets size are carefully considered in the proposed design framework. Magnetic levitation allows the use of a coreless stator that is placed on a supporting structure. The proposed PM motor/generator comprehensive geometry, electromagnetic and mechanical dimensioning are followed by detailed 3-D finite element analysis (FEA). The torque, power, and speed determined by the FEA electromagnetic analysis are met by the application design requirements and constraints for both the charging and discharging modes of operation. Furthermore, the design and analysis of the coil holding structures are discussed. Finally, the motor/generator static thermal analysis is discussed in order to validate the proposed cooling system functionality.},

This paper gives a review of the recent developments in FESS technologies. Due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of FESSs, we survey different design approaches, choices of subsystems, and the effects on performance, cost, and applications.

abstract = {For electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage (ES) batteries, thermal runaway is a critical issue as it can lead to uncontrollable fires or even explosions. Thermal anomaly detection can identify problematic battery packs that may eventually undergo thermal runaway. However, there are common challenges like data unavailability, environment variations, and battery aging. We propose a data-driven method to detect battery thermal anomaly based on comparing shape-similarity between thermal measurements. Based on their shapes, the measurements are continuously being grouped into different clusters. Anomaly is detected by monitoring deviations within the clusters. Unlike model-based or other data-driven methods, the proposed method is robust to data loss and requires minimal reference data for different pack configurations. As the initial experimental results show, the method not only can be more accurate than the onboard BMS, but also can detect unforeseen anomalies at the early stage.},

abstract = {Conventional active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems use several separate radial and thrust bearings to provide a five-degree of freedom (DOF) levitation control. This article presents a novel combination 5-DOF AMB (C5AMB) designed for a shaft-less, hub-less, high-strength steel energy storage flywheel (SHFES), which achieves doubled energy density compared to prior technologies. As a single device, the C5AMB provides radial, axial, and tilting levitations simultaneously. In addition, it utilizes low-cost and more available materials to replace silicon steels and laminations, which results in reduced costs and more convenient assemblies. Apart from the unique structure and the use of low magnetic grade material, other design challenges include shared flux paths, large dimensions, and relatively small air gaps. The finite-element method (FEM) is too computationally intensive for early-stage analysis. An equivalent magnetic circuit method (EMCM) is developed for modeling and analysis. Nonlinear FEM is then used for detailed simulations. Both permanent magnets (PMs) and electromagnetic control currents provide the weight-balancing lifting force. During the full-scale prototype testing, the C5AMB successfully levitates a 5440-kg and 2-m-diameter flywheel at an air gap of 1.14 mm. Its current and position stiffnesses are verified experimentally.},
